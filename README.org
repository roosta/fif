#+TITLE: fif: find in files
* Requirements
  Make sure that [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] version [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.18.0][0.18.0]] or above is installed, and [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat][bat]]
  version [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/tag/v0.10.0][0.10.0]] or above.

  For file concatenation either [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][rg]] or [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] is optionally required, and
  fif will fall back to grep if none of those are present. I recommend
  using [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][rg]] or [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] since those two respect things like git ignore and
  hidden files. Most options passed to these tools are
  configurable. More on that below.

** Forgit
   Used [[https://github.com/wfxr/forgit][forgit]] as an example on how to do zsh plugins and how to
   handle options. Also took some pointer from its [[https://github.com/wfxr/forgit/blob/master/README.md][README]].
